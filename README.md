# Size-Structured-MSE for common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus)

# This repository contains the project files for the size-structured management strategy evaluation (MSE) tool for Atlantic dolphinfish that is currently being developed for the National Marine Fisheries Service, Southeast Fisheries Science Center, and was partially funded by the NMFS-SeaGrant Population and Ecosystem Dynamics Fellowship during Sept. 2020 - March 2023. 

# This repository currently contains a basic operating model (Functions, input.data, data.gen), a wrapper file (om_wrapper) for early Shiny app development, and a .csv file containing estimate indices of relative abundance for dolphinfish in the Atlantic described by Damiano et al. (2023) in Fishery Bulletin. The operating model is a version of the size-structured OM developed for the MARFIN project, which has been modified to include movement/spatial structure for dolphinfish population dynamics and fisheries.

# Technical documentation on model development and assumptions is available here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FDzQlXe5jPv0OMObbjc2wawY4M3m499b/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101463420156894636370&rtpof=true&sd=true

# Certain updates will be added to this ReadMe, while more detailed technical details will be added to the document above.
