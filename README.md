# Size-Structured-MSE
# This repository contains the project files for the size-structured management strategy evaluation (MSE) tool that was developed for a NOAA Marine Fisheries Initiative (MARFIN) project during 2019-2023.

# The original goals of this project were to test a series of management strategies against commercial and recreational objectives for two Southeast marine stocks: South Atlantic black sea bass and Atlantic cobia, forecast quantities of interest such as catches by fleet, recruitment, abundance, and spawning stock biomass (SSB), and evaluate tradeoffs where they occur.

# This repository contains R files for the generalized size-structured operating models conditioned to mimic the most recent stock assessments for black sea bass (2023) and cobia (2020), respectively, and the size-structured stock assessment ADMB file developed by Cao et al. (2017). 

# For a complete description of how the operating models work, see Damiano et al. (2023) in (pub name here), and for a complete description of the assessment model, see Cao et al.'s paper: Improving assessment of Pandalus stocks using a seasonal, size-structured assessment model with environmental variables. Part I: Model description and application https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2016-0020

# Model updates will be catalogued in this read.me as well as additional project updates that make use of the framework
